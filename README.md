# UAV-Assisted-Vehicular-Communications

This study proposes vehicular communication supported by multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs). Resource allocation and trajectory design for
downlink energy-efficient UAV communication were described in the study. Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiple Access (OFDMA) wireless communication protocols were used in this experiment. The optimization
challenge involves trajectory planning, power allocation,
subchannel allocation, and UAV-to-vehicle connection in
order to maximize the total data rate in a highway
situation. It is challenging to obtain an optimal solution
for this non-convex optimization issue. Genetic Algorithm is used to get the optimal solution.
